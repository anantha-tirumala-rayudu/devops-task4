# DevOps Task 4 – Git Workflow Project

## 🎯 Objective

This project demonstrates the use of Git version control following DevOps best practices. The goal is to manage a project with proper branching, commits, pull requests, tagging, and documentation workflows.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Git
- GitHub

---

## 🔁 Branching Strategy

- `main` – Stable production-ready code
- `dev` – Integration branch for testing features
- `feature` – For developing new features before merging to `dev`

---

## 📌 Git Features Implemented

- Git repository initialized and connected to GitHub
- Branching and merging strategy followed
- Pull Requests (PRs) used to merge branches
- `.gitignore` used to exclude unnecessary files
- Tag `v1.0` created for versioning
- Markdown documentation provided

---

## 📄 Files Included

- `README.md`: Documentation of the project and workflow
- `.gitignore`: Ignores `node_modules/`, `.env`, and other local files
- `feature.txt`: Sample file added in feature branch for demonstration

---

## ✅ Outcome

By completing this project, I gained practical experience with:

- Git workflow in real-world projects
- Branching and merging via PRs
- Version tagging
- Markdown documentation in a DevOps context

---

## 🧠 Interview Prep

The project also helped reinforce my understanding of:
- Merge vs Rebase
- Pull Requests and conflict resolution
- Git Tags and Stashing
- Git workflow models (Feature-Branch Model)
